Nounish blockies is an infinite, open edition, pay what you want (optionally free) 100% on-chain generative art project based on [Nouns](https://nouns.wtf) and [Blockies](https://github.com/topics/blockies) identicons. 

The goal behind the project is to make the Nouns meme more accessible with cheap, always available uniquely identifiable tokens that are still useful for identity (PFPs, reputation building, in-group signaling).

On Ethereum [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x76152c311630bbe2b472afe779f478b293cfaed3). 

Mint on abi.ninja [here](https://abi.ninja/0x76152c311630bBE2b472afE779f478B293CFAed3/mainnet?functions=mint).

## Features

- Pay what you want, unlimited mints, only required to pay gas
- Each NFTs head is randomly generated based on the owners Ethereum address.
- All tokens held by an account have the same head. All other traits are generated by the Nouns seeder contract following the same conventions as Nouns (generated at mint time using on chain pseudo-randomness).
- Sending an NFT will cause the head trait to change, all other traits remain the same.
- It is tightly integrated with Nouns by using the SVG renderer for all traits (except the head)
- Generate Nounish Blockies using the Nouns color palette using the public `getHeadSvg(address)` function
- Render a Nounish Blockie for free with `renderNounishBlockie(address,seed)`
  - Enter and address (determines the head) and a seed (determines the body). A seed is a tuple with 5 elements (e.g. `[1,12,141,61,10]`)

```solidity
  struct Seed {
      uint48 background;
      uint48 body;
      uint48 accessory;
      uint48 head;
      uint48 glasses;
  }
```

## Heads and bodies

All of these are held by the same account -- heads match.

The same blockie transferred between accounts will change heads, but everything else stays the same.
