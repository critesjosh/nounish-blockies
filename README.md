Nounish blockies is an infinite, open edition, pay what you want (optionally free) 100% on-chain generative art project based on [Nouns](https://nouns.wtf) and [Blockies](https://github.com/topics/blockies) identicons. 

The goal behind the project is to make the Nouns meme more accessible with cheap, always available uniquely identifiable tokens that are still useful for identity (PFPs, reputation building, in-group signaling).
